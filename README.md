# Home-security-system-with-arduino
raw code for  sensors (hss) w/ arduino

1. DHT22 
This code makes use of dht22 sensor to measure temperature , humidity and heat index. 

2. DHT22_with_Lcd
This code does has the same function as that of previous code , the only difference is that temperature and humidity is also displayed to lcd. 

3. IR
Simple code which uses IR sensor to detect movement.

4. MQ6
MQ6 sensor is the main sensing component which is used in a gas detection appliance. So this code helps alert us if there is a gas leak. 

5. ir+mq6
Just a combined code for both ir and mq6.
